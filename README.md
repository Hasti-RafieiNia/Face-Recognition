# Face-Recognition
Here are all the related files and codes I used for my Bachelor thesis!

You can see the "5000image_selection.ipynb" which was used to select only 5000 image out of over than 20000 images of UTKFace dataset in a way that equal number of different ages, genders and races were included. The same method was used to select 1000 images out 5000 for validation. 
You also have access to weight files of trained module of YOLOv8, YOLOv5 and Faster-R-CNN.
Finally "Main_Code.ipynb" was designed to give the weight file, two target faces and a video to the code and have red bounding boxes around target faces with the name and yellow bounding boxes around all other faces.
